a minecraft smp plugin

makes survival with friends slightly more interesting

## utility commands

- /playtime -> keeps track of time spent on the server
- /afk -> allows time to continue
- /lag -> sends server tps and your ping (ms)
- /ping -> pings a player
- /pinglocation -> highlights a block that you are looking at
- /compliment -> compliments a player

## things i added

- waypoints -> lodestones have more use now (shift-right click on one to open waypoint menu)
- zzz -> snore while sleeping
- alcohol -> i do not recommend
- drugs -> i also do not recommend
- elytra upgrades -> unnecessary but cool i guess
